    <div class="flowerTypes">
      <p class="flowersSubTitle">Flowers by name</p>
      <p class="flowersText">Flowers are a vital part of the world's eco-system and are the basis of all life on earth. Not only do they
        produce oxygen for us to breathe, but they also provide food for birds, insects and animals on every continent.
        They grow on the highest mountains and even underwater and every country has their own unique varieties. </p>
      <p class="flowersText">There are thousands of varieties of flower in the world today and each one has its own history, specific name
        and place of origin. You can also discover for yourself the different colours in which flowers bloom and what
        unique scents they produce, if any. </p>

      <p class="flowersSubTitle">Flowers by colour</p>
      <p class="flowersText">Flowers come in a variety of colours, with shades ranging from purest white to almost black. Their pigment can be affected by species, environment, time of year and diet so there is always plenty of choice when searching within a specific colour group.</p>
      <p class="flowersText">From red roses on Valentine's Day or white calla lilies at a wedding, colour has as an important a role as scent, style and shape. Every colour can evoke a different emotion within us and they can help improve our mood or give us a boost when we need it most.</p>

      <p class="flowersSubTitle">Flower personality</p>
      <p class="flowersText">Just as there are many different kinds of flower in the world; people have a variety of ways they can express themselves. Our personality shapes who we are and every day can be different when it comes to our moods and our outlooks on life.</p>
      <p class="flowersText">For every change in your day, there is a flower personality to match. Whether you’re feeling bright and breezy or serene and reflective, we have gathered to perfect flowers to compliment your emotions.</p>
      
      <p class="flowersSubTitle">Flowers by scent</p>
      <p class="flowersText">In nature, plants and flowers use scent to attract birds and insects to them in order to pollenate. As each bird, bee or insect lands on a flower it picks up pollen and, when it lands on the next flower, it leaves some behind while taking away new pollen.</p>
      <p class="flowersText">Scent is also used as a deterrent to stop herbivores from eating the plant. By producing a foul or bitter scent, the flower can put off potential predators and warn creatures that they don’t taste very nice. This has no effect on insects however as they are attracted to less appealing aromas.</p>
